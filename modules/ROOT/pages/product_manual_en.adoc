= Space Cubics OBC Product Manual =

== Introduction ==
The Space Cubics OBC is an On-Board Computer (OBC) designed for use in CubeSats that are 3U in size or larger.

The Space Cubics OBC is a system that uses a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA as its primary processing unit, featuring an embedded ARM Cortex-M3 core implemented within the FPGA.
By using an FPGA, the type and number of interfaces can be flexibly customized for each CubeSat.
In addition, implementing user-defined IP enables specialized processing without utilizing CPU resources, which can enhance overall system performance.

The Space Cubics OBC includes a PIC16LF877 sub-microcontroller as a secondary system management unit, operating independently from the main processor.
This sub-microcomputer, known as the Timing, Reset, Config & Health Controller (TRCH), manages the system prior to FPGA startup and monitors for anomalies after the FPGA has started.
The Space Cubics OBC features an automatic recovery mechanism that utilizes TRCH to restore the system in the event of an abnormality.

=== Block Diagram ===
The Space Cubics OBC is composed of two boards—an OBC module and an IO board—providing high flexibility by leveraging the capabilities of the FPGA.

The OBC Module provides versatile functionality that remains consistent regardless of interface changes in systems using the Space Cubics OBC.
The IO Board, on the other hand, handles functions that directly impact system configuration—such as transceiver ICs and protocol converter ICs—ensuring compliance with the electrical requirements of the interface.

Users of the Space Cubics OBC can accommodate new satellites by redesigning the IO Board, allowing flexibility even when the satellite system changes.
Although satellite systems may differ, systems sharing the same OBC Module can still reuse much of their software assets.

The OBC Module and IO Board are connected via an 80-pin board-to-board connector.

=== Power Circuit Configuration ===
The power supply circuit configuration of the OBC module is shown below.
Power supply inputs VIN_A (CON1 pins 1, 2, 3) and VIN_B (CON1 pins 78, 79, 80) operate redundantly, generating VDD_3V3_SYS_A and VDD_3V3_SYS_B independently. These two power lines are combined into VDD_3V3_SYS through ideal diodes and supply power to the TRCH and other components. Additionally, VDD_3V3_SYS is also provided externally via the IO board interface (CON1 pin 32). Since VDD_3V3_SYS is shared with internal circuits, its maximum current usage should not exceed 100 mA.

FPGA_PWR_EN activates each power IC, supplying power to internal circuits and external output pins as needed.

The generated power output nodes are equipped with current and voltage monitors, enabling power status monitoring from both TRCH and FPGA (M1-1, M1-2, M1-3, M2-1, M2-2, M2-3).

VDD_3V3_IO is supplied externally through the IO board interface (CON1 pins 37 and 38) and includes overcurrent protection rated at 300 mA.

==== Power Input ====
Power is supplied to the OBC from VIN_A and VIN_B.

The power supply voltage input range is 5.0V ±10%.

VIN_A and VIN_B each supply power to the OBC from independent power circuits to ensure redundancy.
If the OBC has only one power supply input, the same power source can be connected to both VIN_A and VIN_B.

==== User IO Group 1 and 2 ====
User IO Group 1 and 2 are signals connected to the FPGA that can be used freely by the user.
User IO Group 1 is assigned to FPGA Bank 34, while User IO Group 2 is assigned to FPGA Bank 35.

[width="80%",options="header"]
|====
| User IO | Signal Naming Convention | Number of IOs | FPGA Bank | Corresponding IO Power Pin

| Group 1 | UIO1_(Number) | 16 pins | Bank 34 | VDD_UIO1
| Group 2 | UIO2_(Number) | 16 pins | Bank 35 | VDD_UIO2
|====

The User IO Group can be utilized by supplying any IO voltage to VDD_UIO1 and VDD_UIO2.
Apply the correct IO voltage to the IO pin intended for use with the FPGA.

The FPGA IO power supply (VCCO) must be activated following the FPGA power-up sequence.
Applying voltage only when the VDD_3V3 signal from the OBC module is high ensures the FPGA power-up sequence is maintained.

Please configure the circuit according to the following circuit diagram.
This circuit example is for User IO Group 1. When applying it to User IO Group 2, please adjust the pin numbers and other relevant details accordingly.

image::user_io_vdd33.png[scaledwidth=100%]

When using User IO at 3.3 V or when the IO Board consumes less than 0.3 A, VDD_3V3 can serve as the power supply.

image::user_io_vdd16.png[scaledwidth=100%]

If User IO operates at 1.6 V or the IO Board’s current consumption is 0.3 A or more, use VDD_3V3 as the enable signal and provide power from the IO Board’s power supply.

==== Hardware Options and IO Connections ====
User IO Group 3 and WDOG_OUT signals can be routed to either TRCH or the FPGA, depending on hardware configuration.
The connection configuration is fixed at shipment from Space Cubics and cannot be modified via software.

Please note that the signal power domain varies depending on whether it is connected to TRCH or the FPGA, so take care when designing the IO board.

== OBC System Specifications ==
This section outlines the system specifications of the Space Cubics OBC.

The Space Cubics OBC is composed of an FPGA, functioning as the main processor on the board, and a TRCH, which manages the system and operates in coordination with the FPGA.
Users can customize the system freely by modifying both the FPGA logic and the TRCH program.

=== Power-on Operation ===
When power is applied to the OBC, the TRCH initializes first.

The TRCH monitors power status and temperature using sensors on the OBC board. If the conditions for FPGA operation are met, it sets FPGA_PWR_EN to HIGH to enable power to the FPGA.

When the FPGA is powered on, the TRCH uses the TRCH_CFG_MEM_SEL signal to select the memory for FPGA configuration.
After power is applied, the FPGA reads data from the configuration memory selected by the TRCH and carries out its configuration.

=== FPGA Status Monitoring via TRCH ===
TRCH monitors the watchdog signal (FPGA_WATCHDOG) from the FPGA to detect issues with FPGA configuration or software operation.

When the TRCH powers up the FPGA, configuration begins immediately [A].
Once configuration is complete, the Watchdog circuit within the System Monitor implemented in the FPGA begins toggling the FPGA_WATCHDOG signal connected to the TRCH, independent of software operation [B].
The TRCH verifies that the OBC's FPGA system is functioning correctly by checking that the FPGA_WATCHDOG signal toggles at regular intervals [C].
The System Monitor inside the FPGA detects that the Software Watchdog Timer has expired if the software fails to reset (kick) the timer within a set period (initially 128 seconds). When this happens, it stops toggling the FPGA_WATCHDOG signal [D].

=== System Reboot ===
TRCH monitors the Watchdog and Power Cycle Request signals from the FPGA, then initiates the FPGA system power cycle when necessary.

If the FPGA software fails to trigger the Software Watchdog Timer within a specified time due to a problem in the FPGA system, the FPGA_WATCHDOG signal stops toggling after a set period.
When TRCH detects that the FPGA_WATCHDOG signal has stopped, it switches off the FPGA power [A].

Before turning the FPGA power back on, the TRCH changes the configuration memory used by the FPGA [B].
This feature enables the FPGA to boot using data from a different configuration memory upon restart.
After the configuration memory is switched, the FPGA is powered on again to complete the power cycle [C].

Changes to configuration memory occur both when a fault is detected by the watchdog and when the system is restarted in response to a power cycle request signal from the FPGA.
When performing On the Fly rewriting of the configuration memory, if the new data causes a startup failure, the system will automatically restore the original configuration memory by rewriting it for the next startup and issuing a Power Cycle Request.

== Board Status Circuit ==
The OBC Module has a function to monitor the OBC board status (power and temperature).

=== Power Status Monitoring ===
A Current and Voltage Monitor is integrated into the power supply nodes provided by the OBC Module.
The Current and Voltage Monitor IC uses a TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INA3221-Q1 to communicate with both the TRCH and FPGA through an I2C interface, providing power data readings.

The monitoring nodes for the Current and Voltage Monitor are specified as follows.
